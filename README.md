# Quantum-Optics-in-Laser-Interferomerty
Utilizing Quantum Optics to Optimize Accuracy in Laser Interferometers

Presentation on November 15, 2022

I worked on reducing the noise in the Gravitational Wave detectors by injecting squeeed vacuum into the interferometer to beat thestandard quantum limit. First I studied about the various noise sources in the detector. Then I worked on narrowing the cavity bandwidth via Optomechanical interaction. Then I worked on broadening the detector's bandwidth using acasual optomechanical cavity. I also performed the corresponding modelling and simulations.
